		  <h3>About QERM</h3>
		  <p>Quantitative Ecology & Resource Management (QERM) is a
		    unique interdisciplinary graduate program designed for
		    students interested in applying quantitative tools to
		    ecological and resource management issues. Students
		    receive intensive training in the application of
		    statistical, mathematical, and decision sciences to
		    terrestrial and aquatic ecology, natural resource
		    management, biometrics, and mathematical biology.</p> <p>  Check out what other QERMies and QERM

		<h3> Education </h3>
		    <p>I received a B.S. from <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/" target="_blank"> Oregon State University</a> 
			in Wildlife Science in 1999.  
			My advisers in the <a href="http://fw.oregonstate.edu/" target="_blank"> Department of Fisheries and Wildlife</a> were Dan Edge and Jerry Wolff.
			My undergraduate research was on small mammal populations in a native wetland prairie 
			in the Willamette Valley.  I also worked as a field technician during summers on 
			various research projects concerning the ecology of bats, stream amphibians, and small mammals.
			I realized the importance of statistics in ecological research, so I obtained
			a minor in Statistics as part of my undergraduate work.  </p>
			   
			   <p>I liked learning mathematics and statistics
			   so much that I decided to continue it in graduate school.  I joined the graduate program
			   in the <a href="http://stat.oregonstate.edu/" target="_blank">Statistics Department</a> at Oregon State, where I was 
			   advised by Fred Ramsey and Cliff Pereira. I was also a teaching assistant there for a variety of
			   undergraduate and graduate statistics courses. I received my M.S. in Statistics in 2001.   </p>
			   
			   <p> Fast forward several years, and I am back in school as a Ph.D. candidate in the 
			   <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/qerm/" target="_blank">Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management</a> (QERM) interdisciplinary program at the 
			   University of Washington.  I started the program in 2012 and I am currently working on 
			   research.  My adviser is <a href="https://www.stat.washington.edu/vminin/" target="_blank">Vladimir Minin</a> in the <a href="https://www.stat.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Statistics</a>.  Take a look at my <a href="research.html">research</a> page to learn more.</p>

		  <h3>Work</h3>
		  <p> After completing my graduate work at Oregon State in 2001, I started working
		  as a Statistical Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html" target="_blank"> Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center </a> (FHCRC) in Seattle.  I worked for the <a href="https://www.swogstat.org/" target="_blank"> Southwest Oncology Group Statistical Center </a>
		  on clinical trials.  I was part of the Genitourinary group under Cathy Tangen and also 
		  assisted with statistical research projects under Donna (Pauler) Ankerst.
		  </p>
		  <p>I enjoyed working at FHCRC, but was looking for more of a challenge and 
		  wanted to get back to my roots in ecology.  In early 2005, I started my current position as a 
		  Mathematical Statistician at the<a href="https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov" target="_blank"> Northwest Fisheries Science Center</a> (NWFSC) in Seattle.
		  The NWFSC belongs to the National Marine Fisheries Service, which is part of 
		  the <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA).   
		  </p>

		  
		  <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
		  <p>
		    I am originally from southwest Michigan, but have lived in several states over the years.
			I started my career as a musician, but that was short-lived.  I still play classical guitar
			in my free time.  I enjoy getting outdoors for hiking, fishing, birding, and just general site seeing.  
			I am also a devoted student of kendo.
