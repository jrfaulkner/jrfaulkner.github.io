 		<h2> Locally-adaptive nonparametric smoothing </h2>

         <p>I am working with <a href="https://www.stat.washington.edu/vminin//" target="_blank" >Vladimir Minin</a> on developing locally-adaptive smoothing methods based on Markov random fields and shrinkage priors. This approach offers a flexible and fully Bayesian method for fitting trends or surfaces with locally sharp features or varying smoothness.  We have developed methods for one-dimensional problems and are applying them to phylodynamics and mark-recapture.  We are also currently extending the method for spatial applications.  I have developed an R package titled spmrf for fitting nonparametric models using our method, which is located on this <a href="https://github.com/jrfaulkner/spmrf" target="_blank" >GitHub repository</a>.

		<h2> Latent Variable Methods for Mark-Recapture </h2>

         <p> We work with mark-recapture data on massive numbers of individually-tagged fish, but the data suffer from very low detection probabilities.  We need to model the survival and migration of these fish as functions of time-dependent covariates which are only measured at detection sites.  We are working on Bayesian methods to jointly model the migration, survival, and detection processes while accounting for latent passage times of undetected fish.  We are also working to find solutions to the computational challenges presented by the massive data sets.

		<h2> Ecological Modeling of Salmon </h2>

         <p> Much of my research has focused on finding better ways to model the migrational process of threatened and endangered stocks of juvenile salmon passing through the system of dams and reservoirs on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. These include models for survival, migration timing, travel time, passage routing at dams, and smolt-to-adult returns.  Many of these models are used to inform the Comprehensive Passage (COMPASS) model, which was developed through collaboration between NOAA, University of Washington, and other state, federal, and tribal interests, and is mainly used for evalution of potential management decisions.  Some related publications and presentations are:

		 <h2> Time Series Analysis  </h2>

        <p> I am working with  <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/dbp/" target="_blank" > Don Percival </a> on a novel test for detection of white noise in time series.  This started as my student project in Percival's time series course and is working its way into a paper which is close to submission. The following are slides from an electronic poster presentation at JSM in 2014:
